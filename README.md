# Brain Games

The "Brain Games" application is a set of five command-line controlled mathematical games. The user can choose any of the five games in which he is asked questions. To complete the game, you need to correctly answer three questions in a row, after which the game will end. Also, the game immediately ends with any incorrect answer. In this case, the correct answer is shown. \
The application architecture allows you to connect many games. Now, five games are available:
- Determining an even number
- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated
- Determining the best common divisor
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
- Determining a prime number
